/*
Write a function that takes in a time in seconds (as an integer) and returns a string in the format "HH:MM:SS". For example, if the input is 3661, the output should be "01:01:01".

Here are some additional requirements and constraints:
1. The input time will be a non-negative integer.
2. The output should always have two digits for hours, minutes, and seconds (for example, "01" instead of "1").
